   index.html
   questions.json
   /assets/background.mp4
   /assets/ambient_loop.wav
   ```
3. Commit and push.

4. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages**.

5. Under "Source", select **Deploy from branch**, set branch = `main`, folder = `/ (root)`.

6. Save. GitHub will give you a URL like:
   ```
   https://your-username.github.io/bio-quiz/
   ```

7. Open that link ‚Äî the quiz should load with your galaxy video background.

## üìù Editing Questions

- Default questions are stored in **questions.json**.  
- To update questions, edit that file in your repo.

  ```json
  [
    {
      "question": "What is in a hydroxyl group?",
      "options": ["-OH", "-COOH", "-NH2", "-CH3"],
      "answer": 0
    }
  ]
  ```
