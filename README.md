# Biology Quiz ‚Äî Galaxy Edition

This is an interactive quiz game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## üöÄ How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (for example: `bio-quiz`).
2. Upload these files to the root of the repository:
   ```
   index.html
   questions.json
   /assets/background.mp4
   /assets/ambient_loop.wav
   ```
3. Commit and push.

4. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages**.

5. Under "Source", select **Deploy from branch**, set branch = `main`, folder = `/ (root)`.

6. Save. GitHub will give you a URL like:
   ```
   https://your-username.github.io/bio-quiz/
   ```

7. Open that link ‚Äî the quiz should load with your galaxy video background.

## üìù Editing Questions

- Default questions are stored in **questions.json**.  
- To update questions, edit that file in your repo.  
- The format is:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "question": "What is in a hydroxyl group?",
      "options": ["-OH", "-COOH", "-NH2", "-CH3"],
      "answer": 0
    }
  ]
  ```
- Players on the live site can also upload their own question sets via the **Settings ‚Üí Upload Questions** option.

## üéµ Music

- A default background loop is included (`/assets/ambient_loop.wav`).
- Players can toggle music or upload their own audio file in the settings tab.

## üé• Background Video

- A galaxy background video is included (`/assets/background.mp4`).
- It loops at **0.1√ó speed** for a slow, ambient effect.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallbacks

To prevent loading issues, the quiz has built-in fallbacks:

- **Questions:** If `questions.json` fails to load, the quiz automatically uses the embedded **49 Biology Chapter 3 questions**.  
- **Video:** If `background.mp4` is missing or fails, the video is disabled and the quiz still runs.  
- **Music:** If `ambient_loop.wav` is missing, the music toggle is disabled, but gameplay continues.  

In each case, a small **toast-style message** appears at the top of the screen and fades away after a few seconds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Video Size Note

GitHub has a file size limit of **100 MB per file**. If your background video is larger, compress it or host it elsewhere.
